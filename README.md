# Foodora

Digital food menu vendors can create and get foodies to scan the QR code.


## What inspired me

- One day, I went to a cafeteria where, after completing my lunch, I got my bill. And it was higher than the prices mentioned in the menu. They said they have changed the pricing and have not updated the menu.

- And this is how the idea of the Foodora app was born. I decided to eliminate all the problems customers and owners face with physical food menus.

- Foodora allows food vendors to create their menus digitally and change them any time they want. And no matter how many customers are present at any time, a food service menu will be necessary. All the customers can scan the foodora QR code to get the menu on their smartphones.


## What I learned

- By completing this project, I learned the complete lifecycle of an app's creation. From gathering user requirements to generating wireframes of the app and building the first prototype, I learned how to approach a problem statement.

- I also learned how to think on a whiteboard and create logic that can be easily converted into code.

- I was able to brush up on my skills as a React Native mobile developer and learned how to build small components and bind them together to make a fully flexible app.

- I had never used native smartphone APIs like camera and media library before, but this project taught me how to play with them to create something useful.


## How I built this project

- When this idea came to my mind, I first understood the problem statement. What problem am I solving?

### I came up with these problem statements that I needed to solve

- Food vendors currently need to spend a lot of money to generate food menus.
- They have to do it again if new items are added or deleted from the menu.
- Price changes are very tedious because one can not print those expensive menus again and again.
- No matter how many menus a street vendor keeps, it will always be less than the number of consumers in the line.
- After pandmic, it's not hygenic to touch food menus that have been touched by others before us.

### After analising the problem statement, I came up with solutions

- Food vendors can install the Foodora app on their smartphones. And they can add food items they want to their menu at their price.
- After doing that, with just the press of a button, a QR code can be generated. They just need to print one copy of this QR code and keep it at their stall or restaurant.
- Foodies then use the same app to scan this QR code and the menu will be presented on their screen.
- Vendors can add, update, and delete food items from the menu at any time and any number of times. And there is no need to generate the QR code again. The menu will automatically be updated, and consumers will always get an updated menu.
- The experience becomes much more satisfying.




## Challenges I faced

- I wanted to make this app user-friendly so that no one needs to explain to the vendors or the foodies what to do, so it took me 5 days to create a wireframe of the app that is easily understood.

- I'm a React native developer, so it was not difficult for me to start coding with it. But I hit my second road block when I started integrating the camera and media library api of the smartphone, as I had never worked with that before. After hours of reading documentation and stackoverflow answers, I was able to implement it in my app.

- The final challenge was to bring everything together and create a unified experience. Create an app workflow that works seamlessly. I spent hours just sitting in my character and reading my own code to optimise it.
